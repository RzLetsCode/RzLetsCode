## Selected Projects

- **Enterprise LLM Platform on Snowflake & LangGraph**  
  Orchestrated an LLM architecture using Snowflake for governed data, LangGraph for workflow orchestration, and a vector store for semantic retrieval; integrated with Azure-hosted LLMs and enterprise APIs. [memory:8][memory:12]  

- **MCP & Agentic Compliance Assistant**  
  Designed an MCP-driven agent framework to connect LLMs securely to internal systems, enabling auditable workflows for policy checks, document analysis, and automated actions. [memory:8][memory:9]  

- **Automated Brochure Generator**  
  Built a pipeline that takes a company URL, scrapes key information with Python & BeautifulSoup, and generates concise marketing brochures using LLMs. [memory:11]  

- **Code2CareerAI**  
  Content and tools helping engineers prepare for AI/ML roles, portfolio building, and practical GenAI adoption in real-world projects. [memory:10]
